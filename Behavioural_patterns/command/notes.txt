The **Command Design Pattern** is a behavioral design pattern used to encapsulate 
requests, operations, or actions into objects. It allows you to decouple the sender of 
a request from its receiver, making it easier to add new commands, undo/redo operations,
and maintain a flexible codebase.

### **Key Participants in the Command Pattern**
1. **Command Interface**: Declares a method (e.g., `execute()`) that all concrete 
    commands must implement.
2. **Concrete Command**: Implements the `Command` interface and defines the specific 
    action.
3. **Invoker**: Requests the command to execute the operation.
4. **Receiver**: The actual object that performs the work.
5. **Client**: Configures the concrete commands and associates them with the invoker.


### **Benefits of the Command Pattern**
1. **Decoupling**: Separates the object that invokes the operation from the one that 
    performs it.
2. **Extensibility**: Easily add new commands without altering existing code.
3. **Undo/Redo Functionality**: By maintaining a history of commands, undo/redo can be 
    implemented efficiently.
4. **Macro Commands**: Combine multiple commands to perform complex operations.

### **Common Use Cases**
- GUI buttons or menu items that trigger different actions.
- Queued execution of operations in systems like task schedulers.
- Implementation of undo/redo functionality in text editors or design tools. 
- Macro recording systems. 

Enhancements
Undo Functionality: Add an undo() method to the Command interface and implement it in 
concrete commands.
Command Queue: Maintain a history of commands to support batching or macro operations.
